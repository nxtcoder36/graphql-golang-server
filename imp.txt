1st way:

https://graphql.org/code/  # get graphql dependencies from here

Ex1:- git clone git@github.com:howtographql/graphql-golang.git(https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-go/0-introduction/)

Ex2:- git clone git@github.com:rahul-yr/learn-go-graphql.git(https://levelup.gitconnected.com/develop-a-todo-graphql-server-in-golang-2bc6ecae1463)

go get github.com/graphql-go/graphql (used graphql for go in this project)

go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin
Gin is a web framework written in Go. It features a martini-like API with performance that is up to 40 times faster thanks to httprouter. If you need performance and good productivity, you will love Gin.

Gin middleware/handler to enable CORS support.
go get github.com/gin-contrib/cors

From postman:
select the body as graphql
if query
query{
    todos{
        id,
        completed,
        title
    }
}
if mutation
mutation {
    addTodo(title:"Reading"){
        id,
        title,
        completed
    }
}

2nd way:

go get github.com/99designs/gqlgen
gqlgen is a Go library for building GraphQL servers without any fuss.

add gqlgen to your projectâ€™s tools.go
printf '// +build tools\npackage tools\nimport _ "github.com/99designs/gqlgen"' | gofmt > tools.go
go mod tidy

create a .graphql file that defines your schema.

go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen generate
Use gqlgen to generate Go code based on your schema

cmds: ref(https://www.apollographql.com/blog/graphql/golang/using-graphql-with-golang/)
  go get github.com/99designs/gqlgen
  printf '// +build tools\npackage tools\nimport _ "github.com/99designs/gqlgen"' | gofmt > tools.go
  go mod tidy
  go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen init
  go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen generate (first define the schema and delete all in schema.resolvers.go)

should not modify either of those files(generated.go and model/models_gen.go) since they will be modified by gqlgen as you update your schema.

modify below files:
schema.graphqls: a GraphQL schema file where types, queries, and mutations are defined. The schema file uses schema-definition-language (SDL) to describe data types
and operations (queries/mutations) in a human-readable way.
schema.resolvers.go: a go file with wrapper code for queries and mutations defined in schema.graphqls

open the playground and run

query{
    todoByID(id:1){
        ID,
        Completed,
        Title
    }
}

mutation {
    addTodoItem(title:"Reading"){
        ID,
        Title,
        Completed
    }
}
